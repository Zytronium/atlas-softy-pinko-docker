# Docker

---
This project is all about Docker.

Docker can be used sort of like a virtual machine, but quick to set up and more
customizable. Our sandboxes on the Intranet actually use Docker. Docker is
useful for application testing on specific environments. It can also be used
when testing  if you don't to make sure it won't make changes - which sometimes
may even be damaging - to your local machine.
